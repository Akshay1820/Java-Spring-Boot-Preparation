    1. Can a class have multiple constructors? What is constructor overloading?
        Yes, a class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. This is called constructor overloading. 
        It provides flexibility to create objects in different ways.

    2. Difference between == and .equals() with objects
        To compare object references, we use ==. But to compare object contents or values, we should override and use .equals(). 
        For example, two String objects with the same value will return true with .equals() but false with == unless they point to the same memory.

    3. What is SIB:
        SIB (Static intialization block) is the first block to executed as soon as a class is load in a memory.It is used to instantiate static members.

    4. What is the difference between No-arg constructor and default constructor?
        No-arg constructor is a constructor without arguments.
        Default constructor is a constructor implicitly written by the compiler if a class does not have any constructors. 
        Default constructor is always a No-arg constructor.
